- [x] github handling
- [x] git repository (creation) handling
- [x] venv (creation) handling
- [x] structure
- [x] settings should use `ghutils` for the github urls
- [x] improve `pkgfiles` file content
- [x] better pyproject.toml creation
- [x] combined cli
- [x] add subparsers/commands and reduce to one callable script (e.g. like `git [commit | add | init]`)

After all that
- [x] delete old files
- [x] update README
    - [x] venv
    - [x] logging tools
    - [x] cli tools
    - [x] toc
    - [x] check
    - [x] logo?
- [ ] write tests
    - [x] builder/cli
    - [x] git
    - [x] venv
    - [x] tools
    - [x] ghutils urls
    - [ ] ghutils download (`requests` to the GitHub API are limited, so how can this be done without a real access?)
- [ ] auto-run tests for different Python versions (first tests are promising that 3.10 & 3.11 are working)
- [ ] update pyproject.toml
    - [ ] maybe `dynamic = ["description"]` to create description dynamically (README)?
- [ ] inform about GitHub workflows and tagging
    - [ ] how and when to run tests (with `pytest`) automatically for different versions of Python
    - [ ] how and when to publish automatically to PyPI
    - [ ] tagging and package version
    - [ ] what is best?:
        - branches `main` and `dev`, only run tests and publishing to PyPI on a push to `main` (should failed tests prevent a publishing?), push all little updates to `dev`
        - push all to `main` but tag manually, tagging triggers tests and publishing
- [ ] publish
